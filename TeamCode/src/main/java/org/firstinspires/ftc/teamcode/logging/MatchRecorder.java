/*
 * Records what the robot believed, once per loop, to a CSV you can plot afterwards.
 *
 * This exists because of how vision and shooting failures present. "It shot three
 * and missed two" tells you nothing. The pose at the moment of each shot, whether
 * vision had vouched for the heading, how many tags were in frame, what distance
 * the solution used and what the flywheel was actually doing -- those tell you
 * which of half a dozen things went wrong, and they are gone the moment the match
 * ends unless something wrote them down.
 *
 * Everything that feeds a decision is logged, which is a deliberately wide net:
 * the fused pose AND the raw odometry pose (so drift is visible as the gap between
 * them), velocity as well as position (the moving-shot correction scales with it),
 * both the effective and standing shot distance, and the readiness gates
 * individually rather than one "ready" flag, because knowing WHICH gate was open
 * is the entire diagnosis.
 *
 * What it costs: reading the values already computed this loop and copying them
 * into an array. No formatting, no file access, no allocation -- see MatchLog for
 * why that matters and what happens when storage cannot keep up. LoggingTest
 * measures the per-loop cost; MatchTest runs a whole simulated match with the
 * recorder attached and checks the loop budget still holds.
 *
 *   recorder = new MatchRecorder("teleop", drive)
 *           .withShooter(shooter)
 *           .withAim(command::getLastSolution, selector::getSelected);
 *   // once per loop, after the subsystems have updated:
 *   recorder.record();
 *   // in stop():
 *   recorder.close();
 *
 * The CSV's first column is seconds since the recorder was created, so two logs
 * from the same match line up on it.
