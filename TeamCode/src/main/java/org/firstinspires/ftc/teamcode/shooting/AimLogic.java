/*
 * Shoot-on-the-move aiming, for a robot with no turret.
 *
 * Ported from team 5472's FRC turret solution and adapted: there the turret
 * rotated and the chassis did as it pleased, so the output was a turret angle
 * clamped to a mechanical sweep. Here the ROBOT is the turret, so the output is
 * a field-relative heading for the drivetrain plus the angular velocity needed
 * to keep tracking while translating. Nothing is clamped, because the robot can
 * spin freely -- but a robot is far slower to rotate than a turret, which is why
 * the feedforward below matters more here than it did on the FRC bot.
 *
 * WHY AIMING AT THE GOAL IS WRONG WHILE MOVING
 *
 * A game piece leaving a moving robot keeps the robot's velocity. Shoot straight
 * at the goal while strafing right and the piece drifts right and misses -- by
 * roughly (speed x flight time), which at 60 in/s and half a second is about
 * 30 inches. The fix is to aim at a VIRTUAL GOAL, offset from the real one by
 * exactly the distance the robot's motion will carry the piece:
 *
 *     virtualGoal = goal - shooterVelocity * timeOfFlight
 *
 * That is circular: flight time comes from the shot distance, which depends on
 * where the virtual goal is, which depends on the flight time. So it is solved
 * by iterating to a fixed point. The FRC original ran a fixed three passes; this
 * version iterates until the distance stops moving, because a fixed count leaves
 * the reported distance and the virtual goal derived from slightly different
 * flight times, and that inconsistency alone was worth over an inch of miss.
 *
 * STEPS
 *   1. Look ahead by a phase delay, so we aim where the robot will be once the
 *      command actually reaches the motors, not where it was when we read.
 *   2. Find the shooter's own position and velocity. A shooter mounted off the
 *      turn centre sits somewhere else and is swung sideways when the robot
 *      spins, and that motion goes into the piece too.
 *   3. Iterate the virtual goal against flight time until it converges.
 *   4. Turn that into a robot heading, an angular feedforward, and the distance
 *      to look the shooter setpoint up with.
 *
 * Units are INCHES and RADIANS, matching the rest of this template. The FRC
 * original was in metres; every distance here is inches.
 *
 * This class is pure static maths with no hardware, so the offline suite in
 * tools/verify tests it directly -- by simulating the game piece and checking it
 * lands in the goal.
