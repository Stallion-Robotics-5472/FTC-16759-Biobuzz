# Shoot On The Move

Aiming and shooting while the robot is still driving, on a robot with **no
turret** — so the robot itself has to pivot.

Ported from team 5472's FRC `BOT2-AK` turret solution. See
[`../lib/command/COMMANDS.md`](../lib/command/COMMANDS.md) for the command
framework that drives it.

---

## Why you cannot just aim at the goal

A game piece leaving a moving robot **keeps the robot's velocity**. Shoot
straight at the goal while strafing right and the piece drifts right and misses.

The miss is not subtle. It is almost exactly:

```
    miss ≈ robot speed × time of flight
```

At 60 in/s with a half-second flight, that is **30 inches**. The offline suite
measures 48 inches of miss at the velocities it sweeps. This is the single
biggest reason a robot that shoots beautifully standing still cannot score while
moving.

## The fix: aim at a virtual goal

Aim at a point offset from the real goal by exactly what the robot's motion will
add to the shot:

```
    virtualGoal = goal − shooterVelocity × timeOfFlight
```

```
                         ●  goal
                        ╱│
          aim here ──► ○ │ ← the piece drifts this way
         virtual goal  ╱ │   because the robot is moving
                      ╱  │
                     ╱   │
                    ▭────┘
                  robot, moving right
```

That definition is circular — flight time comes from the shot distance, which
depends on where the virtual goal is, which depends on the flight time — so it is
solved by **iterating to a fixed point**. Three or four passes converge.

> The FRC original ran a fixed three passes. That leaves the reported distance
> and the virtual goal derived from *slightly different* flight times, and the
> inconsistency alone was worth **1.6 inches** of miss in simulation. This
> version iterates until the distance stops moving
> (`AIM_CONVERGENCE_TOLERANCE_IN`).

## What changes without a turret

| | FRC (turret) | Here (no turret) |
|---|---|---|
| Output | turret angle, robot-relative | **field-relative robot heading** |
| Limits | clamped to mechanical sweep | none — the robot spins freely |
| Who drives | chassis independent of aiming | **driver keeps translation, aiming owns heading** |
| Tracking | turret snaps quickly | robot is slow — **feedforward is essential** |

### The angular feedforward

This is the part that makes a turretless SOTM actually work.

While the robot translates past the goal, the direction to the goal **keeps
sweeping**. A heading controller that only sees position error is always
reacting to a target that has already moved, so it permanently trails and the
robot shoots behind. `AimSolution.headingFeedforwardRadPerSec` is the rate the
aim is sweeping at; `DriveSubsystem.driveWithHeadingLock` adds it to the PID
output so the PID only has to clean up what is left.

A turret is fast enough to mostly get away without this. A robot is not.

> The tidy closed-form expression for a static target,
> `(vx·dy − vy·dx) / d²`, is **not** right here: the virtual goal drifts too as
> the shot distance changes, and ignoring that was off by up to 17% in testing.
> `AimLogic` instead re-solves the geometry a millisecond later and differences
> the two aim angles, which captures every term exactly and costs only a few map
> lookups.

### Other things `AimLogic` accounts for

- **Phase delay** — the pose is read, the loop finishes, the command reaches the
  motors, and only then does the robot respond. `PHASE_DELAY_SECONDS` aims at
  where the robot *will be*.
- **An off-centre shooter** — a shooter away from the turn centre both sits
  somewhere else and is *swung sideways* when the robot rotates. That motion goes
  into the piece too (the `ω × r` term). This is a classic cause of a robot that
  shoots well standing still and misses while turning.
- **A shooter that does not fire forwards** — `SHOOTER_YAW_OFFSET_DEG` rotates
  the robot so the *shooter* faces the goal, not the front bumper.

---

## The shot table

`ShooterMap` maps **distance → flywheel rpm, hood angle, flight time**,
interpolating between measured rows and clamping outside them (never
extrapolating — a shooter curve guessed past your data is confident nonsense).

```java
ShooterMap map = ShooterMap.builder()
        //     distance(in)   rpm   hood(deg)  flight(s)
        .add(           18,  1900,     20.0,      0.26)
        .add(           36,  2350,     27.0,      0.40)
        .add(           54,  2800,     32.0,      0.53)
        .build();
```

**Rows are added whole, on purpose.** The FRC version kept three separately-keyed
maps (rpm, hood, flight time) and nothing stopped one of them gaining a data
point the others lacked — the three curves would then interpolate from different
distances and the shot would drift for no visible reason. Here a row is one call,
so they cannot come apart.

**Distances are INCHES.** The FRC original was in metres. Mixing them puts every
shot wildly off.

### Flight time is the column teams skip

It is also the one SOTM depends on. **With flight time left at zero the moving
correction computes a zero offset and does nothing at all** — the robot will
shoot well standing still and miss while moving, with no error message.

You cannot read it off the robot. Time it from a slow-motion phone clip of the
shot. Even a rough value beats zero by a mile.

---

## Setting it up

Everything lives in [`ShootingConstants.java`](ShootingConstants.java), in the
order you should fill it in.

### 1. The goals — derive them from the AprilTags

The tags are already surveyed into the field frame — that is what makes
localization work — so **a tag beside a goal already tells you where that goal
is**. Enter the tag poses once and derive the goals from them:

```java
public static final Map<Integer, Pose2d> TAG_FIELD_POSES = TagGoals.tagTable(
        //        id,            x,     y,  facing (deg)
        11, TagGoals.tagAt(  -36.0,  66.0,  -90.0),
        21, TagGoals.tagAt(   36.0,  66.0,  -90.0));

public static final Goal[] GOALS = TagGoals.from(TAG_FIELD_POSES)
        .goal("hive").fromTag(11).outward(6.0).radius(7.0).worth(5)
        .goal("flower").fromTag(21).outward(6.0).radius(9.0).worth(2)
        .build();
```

Why derive rather than type coordinates twice: a typo in a hand-entered goal
coordinate is **silent**. Aiming is confidently wrong, the pose estimate looks
fine, and nothing flags it. A wrong *tag* pose, by contrast, makes localization
and aiming disagree with each other in a way you can see.

**What deriving does not save you.** It cannot invent the offset from the tag to
the point the piece must pass through, because only the field drawings know that —
a tag on a goal's face is not at the middle of its opening. So you still supply:

| | |
|---|---|
| `outward(n)` | *n* inches in front of the tag's face, along the way it faces (toward the robot) |
| `alongFace(n)` | *n* inches sideways along the face, positive to the tag's left |

That is a ruler measurement off a drawing rather than a coordinate conversion.

`fromTags(2, 3)` averages two tags, for a goal flanked by one either side — the
position lands between them and **both** tags identify it.

Mistakes are loud: an unknown tag ID or a derived goal with no tag throws at
construction rather than aiming somewhere wrong.

A goal with no tag at all can still be declared the long way with
`Goal.named("x", xIn, yIn)` and mixed into the same array.

### Checking the result

Whichever way you enter them, verify with **Shooter Map Tuning**: park somewhere,
compare the `DISTANCE` readout to a tape measure, and adjust until they agree.

### 1b. If you enter coordinates directly instead

```java
Goal.named("primary", 0.0, 60.0)
        .tags(11, 12)
        .radius(6.0)
        .worth(1)
        .build()
```

**The shipped values are placeholders and will aim at the wrong place.** They cannot
be guessed — read them off the season's Competition Manual and field drawings. For
each goal you need:

- **Position**, in this template's frame (origin at field centre, +X right, +Y away
  from the audience, inches). Aim at the point the piece must pass *through* — the
  middle of the opening, not of the structure.
- **Tag IDs** on or beside it, for `TAG_VISIBLE` selection.
- **Its own shot map**, if its height differs from the others.
- **What it scores**, if you want `BEST_VALUE` to use it.

To check a position: run **Shooter Map Tuning**, park somewhere, and compare the
`DISTANCE` readout against a tape measure to that goal. Adjust until they agree.

`radius` is the effective half-width of the opening and sets the heading
tolerance. Use less than the true half-width: the piece has size, the pose has
error, the shot has spread. Two thirds is a fair start.

### 2. Where the shooter is on your robot

`SHOOTER_FORWARD_OFFSET_IN`, `SHOOTER_LEFT_OFFSET_IN`, `SHOOTER_YAW_OFFSET_DEG`.
Measure from the robot's centre of rotation. See the `ω × r` note above for why
this matters more than it looks.

### 3. The shot table

Build it with **Shooter Map Tuning** (below). Five or six rows across your usable
range is plenty.

### 4. Keep the shot range inside the table

`MIN_SHOT_DISTANCE_IN` / `MAX_SHOT_DISTANCE_IN` default to matching the table
exactly. A shot is in range only when **both** the window and the table allow it,
so widening these past the table does not extend the robot's reach — it just
makes the numbers lie. Widen the table first. The offline suite asserts this.

---

## Building the shot table: Shooter Map Tuning

An OpMode (group `Setup`) ported from the FRC `MAP_TUNING` state. The robot
**auto-aims the whole time**, so the distance readout is always honest, but the
shot map is **bypassed** and rpm/hood come from what you dial in.

1. Check `DISTANCE` against a tape measure first. If they disagree, stop —
   the goal's position or the start pose is wrong and nothing else will work.
2. Park at a distance. Hold **LB** to aim; let it settle.
3. `dpad up/down` for rpm, `dpad left/right` for hood. **RT** to fire.
4. When shots go in, press **A** to log the row. It appears on screen as a
   pasteable `.add(...)` line.
5. Move, repeat, then paste the rows into `SHOT_MAP`.
6. Fill in flight time from slow-motion video.

The logged distance is the **standing** distance, not the moving effective
distance — a tuning shot should be taken stationary, and the standing distance is
the honest key.

---

## Using it in TeleOp

`ShootOnTheMoveTeleOp` (group `Drive`) is the reference wiring. The essentials:

```java
aimAndShoot = new AimAndShootCommand(
        drive, shooter,
        () -> -gamepad1.left_stick_y,       // driver keeps translation
        () -> -gamepad1.left_stick_x,
        () -> alliance,                      // for flipping the goal
        () -> gamepad1.right_trigger > 0.5); // fire when ready
whileHeld(() -> gamepad1.left_bumper, aimAndShoot);
```

Hold **LB**: the robot keeps driving wherever the driver puts it while rotating
to lead the goal. Pull **RT**: it feeds as soon as the shot is genuinely ready.
Release LB and heading returns to the driver — the command requires both
subsystems, so both default commands resume automatically.

### When it will not fire

`AimAndShootCommand` gates the feeder on **all** of:

| Condition | Why |
|---|---|
| shot in range and inside the table's data | outside it the setpoint is a guess |
| robot pointed within the tolerance | the tolerance already scales with distance |
| flywheel at speed | feeding during spin-up gives a short shot *and* wrecks the next one |
| **pose trusted** | see below |

`getStatus()` returns one line saying which of these is blocking, so a robot that
will not shoot tells you why instead of sitting there.

### Why pose trust is in that list

Aiming is only as good as the pose, and **a pose seeded 180° out looks perfectly
healthy from the inside** — odometry is self-consistent, the numbers are
plausible, and the robot confidently shoots at empty field.

So the command refuses to fire until MegaTag1 (which is solved without the gyro)
has vouched for the heading. That is the same `isHeadingTrusted()` gate the
localization layer uses; see
[`../LOCALIZATION.md`](../LOCALIZATION.md#catching-a-flipped-start-pose). With
vision disabled the check cannot be made, so it passes and the shot rests on the
seeded pose — as it must, since there is nothing else to go on.

---

## Shooting on the move in autonomous

TeleOp gets the driver to supply translation while the command owns heading. In
autonomous there is no driver, so a *path* supplies translation instead — and the
aiming solution still owns heading. `FollowPathAndShootCommand` is that pairing:

```java
AimAtGoalHeading aim = new AimAtGoalHeading(
        ShootingConstants.newGoalSelector(),
        () -> alliance,
        drive.getLocalization()::getVisibleTagIds);

PathChain plan = new PathChain(
        new Path(leaveStart).setTangentHeading()
                .addMarker(PathMarker.atT(0.33, () -> shooter.setFlywheelRpm(3200))),
        new Path(crossField).setHeadingSource(aim),      // the shooting leg
        new Path(park).setTangentHeading()
                .addMarker(PathMarker.withinInchesOfEnd(18.0, shooter::stow)));

schedule(new FollowPathAndShootCommand(drive, shooter, plan, aim));
```

`ShootOnTheMoveAuto` (group `Auto`) is that routine, authored for red and flipped
to blue at init. Its shape is worth copying: a first leg that gets out of the start
on a plain tangent heading and starts the flywheel partway along, a middle leg that
hands heading to the aiming solution and shoots without stopping, and a park leg
that stows on arrival.

The gates are the same four as TeleOp — in range, aimed, at speed, pose trusted —
so an autonomous will no more fire on an untrusted pose than a TeleOp will.
`getStatus()` gives the same one-line reason.

Two details that are easy to get wrong and are already handled:

- **The solution is computed once.** `AimAtGoalHeading` caches it; the command
  reads `aim.getLastSolution()` back after `follower.update()`. Solving it twice —
  once for heading, once for the shooter — invites the two to disagree, and the
  robot then spins up for a shot it is not actually aiming.
- **The follower does not advance the pose estimate.** `DriveSubsystem.periodic()`
  already does. Letting both do it feeds the estimator two samples microseconds
  apart with no movement between them, which drags the filtered velocity toward
  zero — and the entire moving-shot correction scales with velocity. The command
  calls `follower.setUpdatesLocalizer(false)` for exactly this reason.

See [`../pathing/PATHING.md`](../pathing/PATHING.md#heading-sources-aiming-while-pathing)
for heading sources and markers.

## Choosing which goal to shoot at

BIOBUZZ scores on **hives and flowers**, so there is more than one thing to shoot
at. `GoalSelector` picks one each loop.

A `Goal` is more than a coordinate:

```java
Goal.named("high", 0.0, 60.0)
        .tags(21, 22)          // AprilTags that identify it
        .radius(8.0)           // its opening's half-width
        .worth(5)              // points, for the best-value strategy
        .map(HIGH_SHOT_MAP)    // its OWN curve -- a different height needs one
        .build();
```

Two of those deserve a note. **Tags** are how the robot tells which goal it is
looking at. And a goal at a different **height needs its own shot table** — one
flywheel/hood curve cannot serve two heights, so `Goal.map(...)` overrides the
shared default and `AimAndShootCommand` looks the shot up in the selected goal's
map.

### Strategies

| Strategy | Picks |
|---|---|
| `FIXED` | one goal, chosen by the driver or pinned in code |
| `NEAREST` | the closest |
| `LEAST_ROTATION` | whichever needs the least turning from where you point now |
| **`TAG_VISIBLE`** | goals whose AprilTags the camera can currently identify, ties broken by point value then distance |
| `BEST_VALUE` | the highest-value goal actually in range |

`TAG_VISIBLE` is the default. If no goal's tags are in frame it **falls back to
`NEAREST`** rather than refusing to aim — not seeing a tag usually just means the
camera is pointed somewhere else, which is no reason to give up.

### Tag semantics — check the manual

```java
public static final GoalSelector.TagMeaning GOAL_TAG_MEANING =
        GoalSelector.TagMeaning.VISIBLE_MEANS_AVAILABLE;
```

If tags simply sit beside each goal, seeing one identifies it — that is
`VISIBLE_MEANS_AVAILABLE`. If instead a tag gets **covered** as its goal fills up
or is claimed, then the *hidden* tag marks the available goal, and you want
`HIDDEN_MEANS_AVAILABLE`. Get it backwards and the robot prefers exactly the wrong
goals. Read the Competition Manual and set it to match.

### Why switching is deliberately sluggish

This is the part worth understanding. On a turretless robot the selected goal sets
**the whole chassis heading**. AprilTag visibility flickers constantly while
driving — a tag clips the edge of frame, a game piece passes in front of it — and a
selector that switched on a single frame would swing the robot back and forth
between two headings and never settle enough to shoot at either. A turret could
absorb that. A chassis cannot.

So a switch has to be *earned*: a challenger must win `GOAL_SWITCH_FRAMES`
consecutive updates (default 12, about a fifth of a second) before it takes over,
and selection is **frozen outright while a shot is being fed**, so the target
cannot change out from under a shot in progress. The cost is a fraction of a
second of staleness after the picture genuinely changes — far cheaper than
oscillation.

The suite tests exactly this: a single flickering frame must not switch, an
intermittent challenger must *never* take over, and a frozen selector must not
change at all.

### Driver override

The camera does not know everything the driver can see:

| Control (in `ShootOnTheMoveTeleOp`) | Does |
|---|---|
| `A` | cycle the target goal, pinning it |
| left stick button | hand choice back to automatic selection |

Telemetry shows the current goal, why it was chosen, any challenger and its
streak, and which tags are in frame.

### A single-goal game

Leave one entry in `GOALS` and selection is a no-op — every strategy returns it.
No need to change anything else.

---

## The other way: aim at what the camera sees

Everything above aims at a **field coordinate**. The robot looks up where the goal
is, looks up where it thinks it is, and subtracts. That needs two things to be
right — the goal coordinates and the pose estimate — and when either is wrong the
robot aims at empty field with complete confidence. It is why the shoot commands
refuse to fire until vision has vouched for the heading.

The second mode does not use either. It measures where the target is **relative to
the robot**, from the camera frame, every loop.

| | `GOAL_TABLE` | `VISION_TARGET` |
|---|---|---|
| needs goal coordinates | **yes** | no |
| needs a correct pose | **yes** | no |
| needs the target in frame | no | **yes** |
| can track a goal behind the robot | **yes** | no |
| works with no field map on the Limelight | no | **yes** |
| gated on `isHeadingTrusted()` | yes | no |

Neither is better. They fail in opposite ways, which is why `AUTO` — range off the
camera when it can see the target, fall back to the table when it cannot — is the
default in `ShootOnTheMoveTeleOp`. **START** cycles the mode in a match.

### Why the pose cancels out

This looks like it should not work, so it is worth doing the algebra. The target's
field position is computed as

```
targetField = robotPosition + rotate(relativeToRobot, heading)
```

and the aiming solution then wants the target relative to the shooter:

```
targetField - (robotPosition + rotate(robotToShooter, heading))
        = rotate(relativeToRobot - robotToShooter, heading)
```

`robotPosition` drops out algebraically. A heading error `δ` shifts the computed
target heading by `δ`, but the heading the controller *measures* is shifted by the
same `δ`, so the robot physically points the right way. Velocity comes from the same
odometry frame as everything else, so the virtual-goal correction stays consistent
too. The whole calculation runs in whatever frame odometry happens to believe in,
and the physical answer is right.

The offline suite measures exactly this: the same camera frame described from four
poses — including one displaced 24 in and rotated 180° — produces **0.000000°** of
disagreement in the physical aim, while the goal table from that same pose aims
152° away. And a full simulated match with **no botpose at all** and a pose 36 in
wrong fires 168 times, ranges to within 0.00 in of the truth, and is genuinely
pointed at the goal inside its own 6.88° tolerance.

### What you must measure

Two heights and a camera angle. That is the whole configuration — no field
coordinates, which is the point.

```java
// ShootingConstants
CAMERA_LENS_HEIGHT_IN  = 0.0;   // camera lens above the floor
TARGET_CENTER_HEIGHT_IN = 0.0;  // the tag you are ranging off, above the floor
// VisionConstants
CAMERA_PITCH_OFFSET_DEG = 0.0;  // POSITIVE tilts DOWN, so a camera angled up is negative
```

Range comes out of the elevation angle:

```
horizontalDistance = (targetHeight - cameraHeight) / tan(cameraElevation + ty)
```

**Both heights ship at zero, and the mode stays inert until they are measured.**
That is deliberate: a plausible-looking default height would be a wrong answer
nobody checks. While they are unset, `AUTO` behaves exactly like `GOAL_TABLE` and
the telemetry says why. The mode also refuses — rather than reporting a confident
wrong distance — when the two heights are within 6 in of each other (the tangent
divides by almost nothing, so a tenth of a degree of noise swings the answer by
feet), when the camera pitch's sign makes the elevation impossible, and when the
computed range lands outside 6–300 in.

`VISION_TARGET_TX_SIGN` is `-1.0`: Limelight reports `tx` positive when the target
is to the **right**, and this codebase is CCW-positive. It is a constant rather than
a buried minus sign because it is the one convention here that could not be verified
offline. **Thirty-second check on the robot:** hold a tag to the *left* of where the
camera points and confirm the robot turns *left*. If it turns away, flip the sign.

Why the elevation angle rather than the Limelight's own 3D tag pose
(`getTargetPoseRobotSpace()`)? A single tag's pose solve is noisy and can flip
orientation at range, while the elevation angle is one number off the sensor and
degrades gracefully. And the axis convention of that 3D pose could not be confirmed
offline — an axis guess is a silent 90° aiming error.

### Using it

```java
TargetSource seen = VisionTargetSource.fromConstants(localization::getFiducials);

// TeleOp
new AimAndShootCommand(drive, shooter, forward, left, () -> alliance, fire, true, seen);

// or on a path, exactly like AimAtGoalHeading
AimAtTargetHeading aim = new AimAtTargetHeading(seen);
Path leg = new Path(curve).setHeadingSource(aim);

// or both, with the driver or the situation choosing
SwitchableTargetSource targeting = new SwitchableTargetSource(
        new GoalTargetSource(goalSelector, localization::getVisibleTagIds),
        seen,
        SwitchableTargetSource.Mode.AUTO);
```

Everything downstream is identical: the same virtual-goal solve, the same angular
feedforward, the same readiness gates, the same heading source that lets a path aim
while following. Only the answer to "where is it" changes.

Two behaviours worth knowing:

- **When the target leaves frame** the last measurement is held for
  `VISION_TARGET_HOLD_SECONDS` (0.5 s), as a *field* point — so the robot keeps
  aiming at the right place while it drives, on odometry, which is worth a fraction
  of an inch over that window. A piece crossing the lens should not abandon a shot
  that was about to happen. After that the shot is refused and the telemetry says so.
- **The tracked tag is sticky.** A challenger must be the best candidate for
  `VISION_TARGET_SWITCH_FRAMES` consecutive frames before it takes over, and the
  target cannot change at all mid-shot. Same reason as `GOAL_SWITCH_FRAMES`: here
  the target sets the whole chassis heading, so a flickering detection would swing
  the robot between two aims and never settle on either.

In `AUTO`, the pose-trust gate follows whichever source actually answered. While the
camera is ranging, the shot does not depend on the pose and is not gated on it; the
moment it falls back to the table, the gate comes back. Each shot is judged by what
it actually rests on.

---

## Alliances

Goals are written for one alliance and flipped at run time. `GoalSelector` does it
for you:

```java
Translation2d goal = selector.getTargetPosition(alliance);
```

Nothing else changes. The field frame is absolute, the shot table is
alliance-independent, and the aiming maths never knows which alliance it is
playing. The suite checks that a fully mirrored situation (robot pose, velocity
and goal) produces the exactly mirrored aim.

---

## Simulated matches

`./tools/verify/run.sh` plays a **full red match and the mirrored blue match** with
the real subsystems driving a simulated robot: mecanum forward kinematics from the
actual motor powers, accumulating odometry drift, a camera with a real field of
view that only sees tags when a goal is actually in frame, and time stepped in 20 ms
slices so every controller gets the `dt` it will see on the field.

It checks per match that vision actually corrects drift, that the pose and heading
stay accurate, that the robot fires, that it **never** fires outside its own aim
tolerance or outside the shot table's data, and that the target does not thrash.
Then it checks red against blue: the mirror residual, the final headings, shot
counts and goal choice. They currently mirror to **0.000 in**, which is the evidence
that nothing is alliance-dependent that should not be.

Three failure scenarios run too:

| Scenario | What must happen |
|---|---|
| Robot placed backwards (180° seed) | flagged suspect, **never fires while wrong**, recovers on `seedFromVision()` |
| No Limelight at all | still shoots — the pose-trust gate must not deadlock without a camera |
| Camera lost mid-match | target does not thrash, keeps shooting on odometry, recovers when it returns |

### One thing the sim surfaced

If the robot's **start heading does not put a goal tag in the camera's view**, the
start-pose check cannot run at init, so the pose-trust gate keeps the shooter
blocked until the robot first turns toward a goal. It recovers by itself, but you
lose the pre-match warning that would have caught a wrong alliance button. Orient
the robot — or the camera — so a tag is visible while sitting on the field.

## How it is verified

`./tools/verify/run.sh` tests the aiming maths by **simulating the game piece**
rather than asserting on intermediate numbers — the solution is only correct if a
piece launched along it actually lands in the goal. It launches from the shooter
at the speed the table implies, adds the robot's velocity, flies for the table's
flight time, and measures where it lands.

Across 151 swept combinations of position, heading and velocity:

| | worst miss |
|---|---|
| with the moving-shot correction | **0.0018 in** |
| aiming straight at the goal | **47.99 in** |

It also checks the feedforward against a numerical derivative of the aim angle,
that the iteration converged, that a strafing robot leads the correct way, that
the tolerance tightens with distance, that an out-of-range shot is refused, that
a rotating robot with an offset shooter still gets a correction, and that the
alliance flip mirrors cleanly.

None of that is a substitute for shooting real pieces on a real field — it only
proves the maths does what it claims.

---

## Tuning checklist

| Symptom | Look at |
|---|---|
| Good standing, misses while moving | flight time is probably 0 in the table |
| Good standing, misses while turning | `SHOOTER_FORWARD/LEFT_OFFSET_IN` |
| Robot points 180° wrong | `SHOOTER_YAW_OFFSET_DEG` |
| Trails a moving aim, always behind | raise `PHASE_DELAY_SECONDS`; check `TURN_POWER_PER_RAD_PER_SEC` in `DriveSubsystem` |
| Rotation oscillates while locked | `HEADING_kP` / `HEADING_kD` in `PathConstants` |
| Never fires | read `getStatus()` on the telemetry line |
| Fires but shots are short | flywheel not actually at speed — tighten `FLYWHEEL_TOLERANCE_RPM`, tune `FLYWHEEL_F` |
| Distance readout disagrees with tape | the goal's position, or the seeded start pose |
| Robot swings between two goals | `GOAL_SWITCH_FRAMES` too low |
| Always aims at the wrong goal | `GOAL_TAG_MEANING` inverted, or wrong tag IDs |
| Shot is wrong on one goal only | that goal needs its own `.map(...)` |
