/*
 * Shoot at whatever the camera is looking at, rather than at a coordinate from a
 * table.
 *
 * WHY THIS MODE EXISTS
 *
 * The goal-table mode asks the robot to subtract its own estimated position from a
 * configured field coordinate. That needs two things to be right: the coordinates,
 * and the pose. When either is wrong the robot aims at empty field with complete
 * confidence, which is why the shoot commands refuse to fire until vision has
 * vouched for the heading.
 *
 * This mode needs neither. It measures where the target is RELATIVE TO THE ROBOT,
 * from the camera frame, every loop.
 *
 * And the pose error genuinely cancels -- this is worth spelling out because it
 * looks like it should not. The target's field position is computed as
 *
 *     targetField = robotPosition + rotate(relativeToRobot, heading)
 *
 * and the aiming solution then works out where the target is relative to the
 * shooter as
 *
 *     targetField - (robotPosition + rotate(robotToShooter, heading))
 *               = rotate(relativeToRobot - robotToShooter, heading)
 *
 * The robot position drops out algebraically. A heading error delta shifts the
 * computed target heading by delta, but the heading the controller measures is
 * shifted by the same delta, so the robot physically points in the right
 * direction. Velocity comes from the same (possibly rotated) odometry frame as
 * everything else, so the virtual-goal correction stays consistent too. The whole
 * calculation runs in whatever frame odometry happens to believe in, and the
 * physical result is correct. The offline suite measures this: a pose displaced 60
 * inches and rotated 35 degrees changes the physical aim by under a hundredth of a
 * degree.
 *
 * WHAT IT COSTS
 *
 * It can only shoot at something it can see. The goal-table mode can aim at a goal
 * behind the robot while crossing the field; this cannot. When the target leaves
 * frame the last measurement is held for HOLD_SECONDS -- as a FIELD point, so the
 * robot keeps aiming correctly as it drives, on odometry, which is accurate to
 * inches over a second or two. After that it reports no target and the shot is
 * refused.
 *
 * WHAT YOU MUST MEASURE
 *
 * Two heights and a camera angle, with a tape measure and a phone level:
 * CAMERA_LENS_HEIGHT_IN, TARGET_CENTER_HEIGHT_IN, and
 * VisionConstants.CAMERA_PITCH_OFFSET_DEG. That is the entire configuration -- no
 * field coordinates, which is the point. If the geometry is left unconfigured this
 * refuses to produce a target and says so, rather than reporting a plausible wrong
 * distance.
 *
 * RANGING
 *
 * Distance comes from the elevation angle, not from the tag's 3D pose solve:
 *
 *     horizontalDistance = (targetHeight - cameraHeight) / tan(cameraElevation + ty)
 *
 * A single tag's 3D pose is noisy and can flip orientation at range; the elevation
 * angle is one number off the sensor and degrades gracefully. The Limelight does
 * publish getTargetPoseRobotSpace(), and it is deliberately not used here: its axis
 * convention could not be verified offline, and an axis guess is a silent 90-degree
 * aiming error.
