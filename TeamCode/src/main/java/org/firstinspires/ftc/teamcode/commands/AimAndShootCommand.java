/*
 * Shoot on the move. The command that ties everything together.
 *
 * Every loop it:
 *   1. asks AimLogic where to point, given the pose, velocity and shot table,
 *   2. drives with the DRIVER's translation but the AIMED heading,
 *   3. spins the flywheel and sets the hood for the resulting distance,
 *   4. runs the feeder only once everything genuinely lines up.
 *
 * The robot never has to stop. The driver keeps translating and the aiming
 * solution owns heading, which is the whole point of doing this without a turret.
 *
 * READINESS. The feeder waits for all of:
 *   - the shot is in range and inside the shot table's measured data,
 *   - the robot is pointed within the distance-scaled heading tolerance,
 *   - the flywheel is at speed,
 *   - the pose is trustworthy.
 *
 * That last one matters more than it sounds. Aiming at a coordinate from the goal
 * table is only as good as the pose, and a pose seeded 180 degrees out looks
 * perfectly healthy from the inside -- so this refuses to fire until vision has
 * vouched for the heading. Without that check a mis-seeded robot will confidently
 * shoot at empty field.
 *
 * It is the TARGET SOURCE that decides whether that gate applies. A source that
 * measures the target relative to the robot (VisionTargetSource) has no dependence
 * on the field pose at all, so demanding a trusted pose would refuse a shot that is
 * actually correct -- in exactly the situation that mode exists for. The two modes
 * are otherwise identical from here down.
