# Path Following

A Bézier-curve path follower that drives off the fused Kalman pose estimate
(`Localization`). It's a clean-room implementation of the same approach Pedro
Pathing uses — a vector follower with translational, centripetal, drive, and
heading contributions — written specifically to consume this template's
`PoseEstimator`.

## How it works

Every cycle the follower:
1. Pulls the fused pose from the `Localizer` (implemented by `Localization`).
2. Projects the robot onto the current `Path` (closest point, searched
   forward-only so it can't slip backward).
3. Builds a field-frame command from:
   - **translational** — PIDF pull toward the closest point (cross-track error),
   - **centripetal** — `scale · speed² · curvature` nudge toward the inside of a
     curve so the robot doesn't drift wide,
   - **drive** — PIDF push along the tangent, sized by remaining path length, so
     the robot decelerates into the endpoint.
   The corrective (translational + centripetal) vector gets priority in the unit
   power budget; the drive vector fills what's left.
4. Controls heading independently with a PIDF toward the path's target heading.
5. Hands the field-centric command to the `Drivetrain`, which rotates it into
   the robot frame and mixes mecanum powers.

## Usage

```java
Localization localization = new Localization(hardwareMap);
MecanumDrivetrain drivetrain = new MecanumDrivetrain(hardwareMap);
Follower follower = new Follower(localization, drivetrain);

localization.setStartingPose(new Pose2d(0, 0, new Rotation2d(0)));

Path s = new Path(new BezierCurve(
        new Translation2d(0, 0), new Translation2d(20, 0),
        new Translation2d(10, 30), new Translation2d(30, 30)))
        .setLinearHeading(0, Math.toRadians(90));

follower.followPath(new PathChain(s));
while (opModeIsActive() && follower.isBusy()) {
    follower.update();
}
```

See `opmodes/FollowPathExample` for a complete OpMode.

## Before you drive: check the drivetrain

The follower assumes three conventions hold on your robot:

| command | robot must |
|---------|-----------|
| forward power | drive forward |
| strafe power | slide left |
| positive turn power | rotate **counter-clockwise** |

If any of these is inverted the follower does not merely track badly — it drives
itself *away* from the target. Run the **Drivetrain Direction Check** OpMode
(group `Setup`) first; it drives one motion at a time and tests each wheel
individually.

The classic failure is setting all four motor `Direction`s the same in
`PathConstants`. On a mecanum the two sides face opposite ways, so making them
identical does not reverse the robot — it *swaps translation and rotation*, and
"drive forward" spins the robot in place. Flip both sides together or neither.

`HEADING_CORRECTION_SIGN` should stay at `+1.0`. It exists only for a drivetrain
that inverts rotation. If the robot spins away from its target heading and speeds
up, check the motor directions before touching this constant — a mis-wired
drivetrain is far more often the cause.

## Heading modes

- `setTangentHeading()` — face along the path.
- `setReverseTangentHeading()` — face backward along the path (drive in reverse).
- `setLinearHeading(start, end)` — interpolate by t, shortest angular route.
- `setConstantHeading(h)` — hold a fixed heading.
- `setHeadingSource(source)` — hand heading to a `HeadingSource`, below.

### Heading sources: aiming while pathing

The four modes above are functions of `t` alone — where you are along the path is
all they need. "Keep pointing at the goal" is not: it depends on where the robot
actually is, how fast it is moving, and it wants an angular feedforward as well as
a target angle. So heading is an interface.

```java
public interface HeadingSource {
    Target compute(double t, Pose2d pose, Translation2d fieldVelocity,
                   double omegaRadPerSec);
    default void reset() {}
}
```

`Target` carries a heading and `omegaFeedforwardRadPerSec` — how fast the target
heading is itself sweeping. Zero for anything fixed in the field frame. Non-zero
when the target moves on its own, which is the case that matters: a position-only
controller permanently trails a sweeping target, and a chassis is slow to rotate.
The follower adds it as `omega × TURN_POWER_PER_RAD_PER_SEC`.

`AimAtGoalHeading` is the implementation that matters:

```java
AimAtGoalHeading aim = new AimAtGoalHeading(
        ShootingConstants.newGoalSelector(),
        () -> alliance,
        drive.getLocalization()::getVisibleTagIds);

Path shootWhileCrossing = new Path(curve).setHeadingSource(aim);
```

It computes the full aiming solution once per loop and caches it, so the command
driving the shooter reads back `aim.getLastSolution()` — the same solution the
heading came from — rather than solving it a second time and possibly disagreeing
with itself.

**Why this had to be an interface rather than another enum case.** Before it
existed, "drive this route while tracking the goal" was impossible, and not because
of a missing feature: the follower took heading from the path and the aiming
command took heading from the shot solution, and both of them required the
drivetrain. The scheduler therefore ran exactly one of them. One command that owns
the drivetrain and takes its heading from a pluggable source is the fix.

`AllianceFlip` carries a `CUSTOM` heading source across a mirrored path untouched,
because the goal selector already flips the goal itself at run time.

### Path markers: doing something mid-path

A marker fires a callback once, partway along a path:

```java
Path leg = new Path(curve)
        .setTangentHeading()
        .addMarker(PathMarker.atT(0.33, () -> shooter.setFlywheelRpm(3200), "spin up"))
        .addMarker(PathMarker.withinInchesOfEnd(18.0, shooter::stow, "stow"));
```

`atT(t, action)` fires when the path parameter passes `t`;
`withinInchesOfEnd(inches, action)` fires when the remaining arc length drops
below `inches`. Each fires at most once per run of the path and re-arms when the
path is started again.

This is not cosmetic. A flywheel takes over a second to spin up (the flywheel test
in **Drivetrain Characterization** measures yours), so a shooting leg that starts
the wheel when it begins has already wasted the leg. `ShootOnTheMoveAuto` starts
it a third of the way along the *previous* leg instead, and the shot window opens
with the wheel already at speed.

Markers are polled after the drive command each loop, and
`follower.getMarkersFiredLastLoop()` reports what fired, for telemetry.

## Tuning



All gains and tolerances are in `PathConstants`: the translational, drive, and
heading PIDF gains, the centripetal scale, and the completion/advancement
tolerances. **The defaults are starting points and must be tuned on your robot.**

Increase `TRANSLATIONAL_kP` if the robot tracks loosely; raise
`CENTRIPETAL_SCALE` if it cuts curves wide; tune `HEADING_kP` for crisp turns
without oscillation.

The closed-loop simulation in `tools/verify/` (`./tools/verify/run.sh`) drives
the example two-segment path against an ideal robot and reports whether it
finishes, how long it takes, and its worst heading error. It will not tell you
the right gains for your hardware, but it does catch a change that makes the
follower diverge or never terminate.

### Deceleration feedforward

The drive command is the maximum of a PID output and a physics-based feedforward:

```
targetSpeed = √(2 · ZERO_POWER_DECEL_RATE · remaining)
driveMag    = max(targetSpeed / MAX_ROBOT_SPEED, drivePIDOut)
```

This naturally decelerates the robot to zero at the path end without requiring an
aggressive `DRIVE_kD`.

Do not guess either constant. Run the **Drivetrain Characterization** OpMode
(group `Setup`): it accelerates to a plateau, cuts power, and reports
`MAX_ROBOT_SPEED` and `ZERO_POWER_DECEL_RATE = v² / (2·d)` from the same run, so
the deceleration is measured from the speed the robot actually reached. Full
procedure in `MANUAL.md` §8a. After that, increase the deceleration rate if the
robot overshoots endpoints and decrease it if braking starts too far out.

Both constants can also be edited in the **Gains** tab of the Path Planner and
pasted back into `PathConstants.java` via the generated snippet.

## Path Planner (visual tool)

`assets/pathplanner.html` is a self-contained visual editor. Drag control points
on the field, choose a heading mode per segment, and copy the generated Java
(`BezierCurve` / `Path` / `PathChain`) straight into an OpMode. The field
convention matches the pose estimator: 144"×144", origin at center, +X right,
+Y up, heading degrees CCW.

To use it:
- **From the robot's IP** — `PathPlannerServer` registers a route on the Robot
  Controller's embedded web server, so after deploying the app you can connect
  to the robot's Wi-Fi and browse to:

  ```
  http://192.168.43.1:8080/pathplanner
  ```

  (Use the robot's actual IP; `192.168.43.1` is the typical Control Hub address.)
  This relies on SDK web-server internals, so confirm it once on hardware after
  the first deploy.
- **Locally** — you can also just open `assets/pathplanner.html` in any browser;
  it has no server dependency.

### Swap to the other alliance

**⟳ Swap Alliance** rotates the whole plan 180° about the field center — start
pose, every control point, and the stored heading angles. Click it again to go
back; it's an exact round trip. The generated Java includes a comment showing
the `AllianceFlip` call to do the same thing at run time.

Two true mirrors (**Mirror ⇆ L/R**, **Mirror ⇅ T/B**) live in the Robot tab for
fields that really are mirror-symmetric. They reverse handedness, so they are
*not* an alliance swap on BIOBUZZ — see below.

## Coordinate system and alliances

**There is one field frame and it never changes.** Origin at the field center,
+X right, +Y away from the audience, heading CCW, inches. This is the same frame
the AprilTag map uses, so `Localization` returns absolute poses: a robot parked
on a given tile reports the same pose whether it's red or blue, and whichever
side it started on. Nothing in the follower, the paths, or the gains is
alliance-dependent.

Two things *do* depend on the alliance, and they're kept separate from the frame:

### 1. The driver's point of view (TeleOp)

The two drive teams stand at opposite ends of the field, so "push the stick away
from me" is +X for red and −X for blue. `Alliance.driverForward()` supplies that
offset, and `FieldCentricDrive` rotates the stick vector by it before handing a
field-frame command to the drivetrain:

```
driver frame --(alliance.driverForward())--> field frame --(−heading)--> robot
```

The pose estimate is untouched. If your drive team stands somewhere else,
`driverForward()` is the single value to change.

`FieldCentricDrive` also has a re-zero button (**back**) that redefines the
driver's forward as the robot's current facing, to recover from a bad heading
without restarting.

### 2. Which side an auto runs on

Author the auto once, then flip it at run time with `AllianceFlip`:

```java
private static final Alliance AUTHORED_FOR = Alliance.RED;
private static final Pose2d START = new Pose2d(-58, -58, Rotation2d.fromDegrees(45));

// after the driver picks `alliance` during init:
Pose2d    start = AllianceFlip.forAlliance(START,       AUTHORED_FOR, alliance);
PathChain toRun = AllianceFlip.forAlliance(buildPlan(), AUTHORED_FOR, alliance);
localization.setStartingPose(start);
follower.followPath(toRun);
```

`forAlliance` returns the original object untouched when the alliances match, so
there's no cost on your home side. See `opmodes/AllianceAutoExample`.

TANGENT paths need no heading data adjustment — the tangent is recomputed from
the transformed control points. CONSTANT and LINEAR headings are transformed
explicitly. Curvature (and so the centripetal correction) is also derived from
the transformed points, so it stays correct even under a handedness-reversing
mirror.

### Why 180° rotation and not a mirror

`FieldSymmetry.ROTATIONAL` is the default because BIOBUZZ's alliance halves are
rotations of each other, not reflections. Checked against the Competition Manual
field coordinates — rotating red's elements 180° lands exactly on blue's, while
neither mirror does:

| red element  | red coords                    | rot 180° →            | blue actual           |
|--------------|-------------------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|
| GARDEN       | x −70.5..−47.4, y −70.0..−68.0 | x 47.4..70.5, y 68..70 | x 47.4..70.5, y 68..70 |
| LOADING ZONE | x −70.5..−59.5, y 23.9..46.6  | x 59.5..70.5, y −46.6..−23.9 | x 59.5..70.5, y −46.6..−23.9 |

A left/right mirror would put red's garden at the *bottom*-right instead of the
top-right. Pass an explicit `FieldSymmetry` to any `AllianceFlip` method if a
future field is genuinely mirror-symmetric.

### Setting the starting pose

Seed `setStartingPose` with the robot's real absolute field pose, not `(0,0,0)`
— that's the middle of the field. Odometry is dead-reckoned from whatever you
seed, so a wrong seed means a wrong pose until vision sees a tag and pulls the
estimate in. The template's example OpModes use `(0,0,0)` as a placeholder;
replace it with your actual start.

### Field map

The planner ships with the **2026-2027 BIOBUZZ** field as its backdrop
(`assets/field-biobuzz-2027.png`), so it matches the current season out of the
box. `PathPlannerServer` registers a route for the image alongside the page, so
it also renders when served from the robot.

To plan against a different image (a new season, or the official FIRST field
PNG when you have it), drop the image onto the canvas or use the **Field image**
file picker. It's stretched to the full 144"×144" field, so use a top-down image
whose edges are the field perimeter. The **opacity** slider fades it, and
**Reset** returns to the bundled BIOBUZZ field. A dropped image is saved in the
browser (localStorage), so it persists across reloads and when the page is
served from the robot — no extra asset or server change needed.

If the image is ever missing, the planner falls back to drawing a procedural
field (24" foam tiles, perimeter wall, alliance walls with red at −X and blue at
+X, audience at −Y), so the tool never comes up blank.
